# laminas-progressbar

`Laminas\ProgressBar` is a component to create and update progress bars in different
environments. It consists of a single backend, which outputs the progress through
one of the multiple adapters. On every update, it takes an absolute value and
optionally a status message, and then calls the adapter with some precalculated
values like percentage and estimated time left.
